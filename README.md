# FACETRACK

University Face Attendance System

FACETRACK is a desktop ERP-style identity and attendance system for faculty-driven student attendance using face recognition. Faculty controls student registration, timetable management, and attendance sessions. Students get read-only access to profile, timetable, and attendance analytics.

## Features

- Role-based login for admin, faculty, and students
- Admin-managed faculty registration and timetable assignment
- Faculty-controlled attendance sessions for assigned classes only
- Student registration with webcam face sample capture
- Embedding-based student recognition with Euclidean distance matching
- Weekly timetable creation and today-class attendance workflow
- Duplicate attendance prevention
- Faculty reports with CSV export
- Student dashboard with profile, timetable, and attendance percentage
- SQLite persistence and file logging

## Setup

1. Install Git LFS before cloning or pulling the repository assets:

```bash
git lfs install
```

If Git LFS is not installed on your machine yet, download it from [git-lfs.com](https://git-lfs.com/) and then run the command above once.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohakkalra03/FaceTrack.git
cd FaceTrack
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment.
4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Optional database bootstrap:

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

6. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Default Admin Login

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## Notes

- `face_recognition` is used when available. If it is not installed successfully on the local machine, FACETRACK falls back to a simplified OpenCV-based embedding mode so the application still runs for demonstration and testing.
- Attendance can only be started by faculty after selecting one of today's timetable classes.
- Student accounts cannot create attendance, alter timetable data, or modify institutional records.
